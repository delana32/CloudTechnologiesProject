This project aims to use Pig and Hive to parse Kickstarter Data.
The data can be found at https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/
I have downloaded the most recent file in csv format. Some of the fields are in json but these have been treated in the Pig file to only pull the most relevant value.

Note that to create the Pig Script, I only ran it for the first 4 records of the first file. It's working fine for these so hopefully it will work ok for the rest. 
I'll check this later on.
